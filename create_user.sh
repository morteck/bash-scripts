#!/bin/bash
# User Creation Script
# --------------------
# This Bash script interactively creates a new system user. It prompts for the username,
# full name, and an optional initial group (defaults to the username if left blank).
# The script ensures it runs with root privileges, creates the user with a home directory,
# and prompts to set a password.
